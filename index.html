<p>
From under-resourced schools to high rates of homelessness, constituents of Bronx Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres have no shortage of issues in need of attention from congress. The district Torres represents is the poorest in the entire state. But Rep. Torres’ continued full-throated support for Israel’s deadly war on Gaza has left some of them wondering whether special interest groups are having an outsized impact on his policy priorities.
</p>
<p>
“We protested outside [Torres’] office on October 24th. At the time he had not tweeted about the Bronx in weeks,” Said Richie Moreno, an organizer with the Bronx Anti-War Coalition. Instead, Moreno said, “it was multiple daily tweets about Israel and really attacking criticism of the state of Israel. Attacking those that are speaking out against the genocide that Israel is committing in Gaza.”

These constituents aren’t only taking issue with his refusal to call for a ceasefire or his support for an over $14 billion supplemental aid package to Israel. They're also pointing to his frequent tweets about Israel, a word he mentioned on the social media platform 236 percent more than the word “poverty” since the start of his congressional term according to an Oct. 20 report.
</p>
<p>
“I feel like he's really forgotten about his own constituents in the South Bronx,” said Sonyi Lopez. “We are black and brown people. Working class people. We have a lot in common with the Palestinian people. The fact that they’re being displaced.”
